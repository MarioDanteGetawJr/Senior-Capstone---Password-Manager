# These are the things that still need to be implemented into our project

- Create Presentation/deliverables
- Secure JSON files
- Current Issue – if a user doesn’t have all the necessary python packages installed on their system the app wont run.
  -Somehow, we must remove this necessity, or make very simple, easy to follow instructions on how/what to install.

- If time permits:
  - Add cloud functionality.
      - forgot password button/option (for the main account that controls everything)
  - Make the GUI more visually appealing.
