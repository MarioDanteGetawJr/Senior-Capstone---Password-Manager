# Welcome To Our Senior Capstone Project - Password Manager
(Project is still in development)

- Created by Mario Getaw, Jarrett Wilson, and Joshua Moore. 
- The goal for this project was to combine Computer Science and Cybersecurity principles to create something that anyone can use - and we chose to create a password manager in Python

# How to use our program 
a) **PREREQUISITE** - must be an approved test user because the app is not published.

1) Download the zip file from the releases page (v4.0.0)
2) Watch the tutorial video in the code repository
3) Start saving away!
4) **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** - Password lock and/or hide the folder with the program - the more layers of security, the better!

- **NOTE!!** If you run the raw Python code, it is highly likely that the app will not work properly! Since the app is not public, PasswordManager.py needs access to the client_secrets.json file. The .exe file in the V4.0.0 release will also not run without the client_secrets.json file.
