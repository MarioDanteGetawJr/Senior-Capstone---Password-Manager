# Welcome To Our Senior Capstone Project - Password Manager

- Created by Mario Getaw, Jarrett Wilson, and Joshua Moore. 
- The goal for this project was to combine Computer Science and Cybersecurity principles to create something that anyone can use - and we chose to create a password manager in Python.

# How To Use Our Program: 
a) **PREREQUISITE** - must be an approved test user because the app is not published.

1) Download the zip file from the [releases page (v4.0.0)](https://github.com/MarioDanteGetawJr/Senior-Capstone---Password-Manager/releases/tag/v4.0.0) 
2) Watch the [tutorial video](https://youtu.be/nmmg0FCCxII) on how to use the app.
3) Start saving away!
4) **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** - Password lock and/or hide the folder with the program - the more layers of security, the better!

- **WARNING!!**
  - If you run the raw Python code, it is highly likely that the app will not work properly! Since the app is not public, PasswordManager.py needs access to the client_secrets.json file. The .exe file in the V4.0.0 release will also not run without the client_secrets.json file.
  - In order to properly run the .exe file, you must be on the Windows Operating System.
      - If on Mac/Linux, the .exe file will not run.
      - You may be able to run the raw code, accompanied by the client_secrets.json file in the releases zip folder, but this was not tested due to system limitations.
      - After account creation, if you delete/lose the account on your authenticator, it currently is not possible to recover your password manager account.
