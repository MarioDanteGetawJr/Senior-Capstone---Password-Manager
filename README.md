# Welcome To Our Senior Capstone Project - Password Manager
(Project is still in development)

- Created by Mario Getaw, Jarrett Wilson, and Joshua Moore. 
- The goal for this project was to combine Computer Science and Cybersecurity principles to create something that anyone can use - and we chose to create a password manager in Python
