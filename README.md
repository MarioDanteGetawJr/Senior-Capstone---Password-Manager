# Welcome To Our Senior Capstone Project - Password Manager
(Project is still in development)

- Created by Mario Getaw, Jarrett Wilson, and Joshua Moore. 
- The goal for this project was to combine Computer Science and Cybersecurity principles to create something that anyone can use - and we chose to create a password manager in Python

- **NOTE!!** If you run the raw Python code it will not work! Since the app is not public, PasswordManager.py needs access to the client_secrets.json file. The .exe file in the V2.0.0 release will also not run without the client_secrets.json file.
